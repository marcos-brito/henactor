# Henactor

Henactor is an open-source, highly customizable, keyboard-driven file explorer/manager inspired by amazing software out there. It might have
every feature you expect plus a few you didn't asked for. Here are a few highlights:

-   **Customization:** Bend the UI to your likings by changing icons and writing themes with CSS
-   **Keyboard Driven:** Forget your mouse and bind any command to any key you want
-   **Rclone integration:** Integrate with a rclone server to manage all your cloud storage
-   **Easy searching:** Search you file system by writing boolean expressions with a small language you probably already now

You can find documentation and guides for everything at [Henactor's documentation](https://marcos-brito.github.io/henactor).
